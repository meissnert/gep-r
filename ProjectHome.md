## Summary ##
This software allows creating a gene expression based report based on Affymetrix raw-data for the risk stratification of an individual patient based on saved preprocessing information of a reference cohort by treating the individual patient's expression data as being part of this group, assuring comparable risk stratification. Results can be interpreted and commented within the report and a PDF based document be created. The generation of the report can be performed within short time on a standard computer.
